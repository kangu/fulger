> Point-of-sale solution for handling lightning (micro)payments

The lightning network facilitates international near-instant settlements using a hard asset. ZapPay aims to
be a personal assistant in handling  transaction for a shop or business online presence.

The main philosophy behind it is digital minimalism, in this particular case using the least amount of
tools and potential complexity for managing the specific task of working with payments from end-to-end.
